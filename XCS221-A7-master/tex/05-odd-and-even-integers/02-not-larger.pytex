\item \points{5b}
Suppose we added another constraint:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., start=7]
  \item A number is not larger than itself.
\end{enumerate}

Prove that there is no finite, non-empty model for which the resulting set of
seven constraints is consistent.

{\em Hint: Consider a finite, non-empty model, assume that all the constraints
can be satisfied, then prove by contradiction.}
