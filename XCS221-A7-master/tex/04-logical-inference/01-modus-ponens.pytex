\item \points{4a}
Some inferences that might look like they're outside the scope of Modus ponens
are actually within reach. Suppose the knowledge base contains the following two
formulas:
\[\text{KB} = \{ (A \vee B) \to C, A  \}.\]

{\bf Your task:}

First, convert the knowledge base into conjunctive normal form (CNF). Then apply
Modus ponens to derive C. Please show how your knowledge base changes as you
apply derivation rules.

{\em Hint: You may use the fact that $P \to Q$ is equivalent $\neg P \vee Q$.

Remember, this isn't about you as a human being able to arrive at the
conclusion, but rather about the rote application of a small set of
transformations (which a computer could execute).}
