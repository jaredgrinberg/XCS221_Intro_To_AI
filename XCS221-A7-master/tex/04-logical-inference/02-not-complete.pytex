\item \points{4b}
Recall that Modus ponens is not complete, meaning that we can't use it to derive
everything that's true. Suppose the knowledge base contains the following
formulas:
\[\text{KB} = \{ A \vee B, B \to C, (A \vee C) \to D \}.\]
In this example, Modus ponens cannot be used to derive $D$, even though $D$ is
entailed by the knowledge base. However, recall that the resolution rule is
complete.

{\bf Your task:} Convert the knowledge base into CNF and apply the resolution rule repeatedly
to derive $D$.
