\item \points{1b}
Suppose a time step has elapsed and we got another sensor reading, $D_3 = 1$,
but we are still interested in $C_2$. Compute the posterior distribution
$\mathbb P(C_2 = 1 \mid D_2 = 0, D_3 = 1)$. The resulting expression might be
moderately complex. We encourage you to draw out the (factor) graph.
