\item \points{1c}
Suppose $\epsilon = 0.1$ and $\eta = 0.2$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute and compare the probabilities $\mathbb P(C_2 = 1 \mid D_2 = 0)$
  and $\mathbb P(C_2 = 1 \mid D_2 = 0, D_3 = 1)$. Give numbers, round your answer to 4 significant digits.
  
  \item How did adding the second sensor reading $D_3 = 1$ change the result?
  Explain your intuition for why this change makes sense in terms of the car
  positions and associated sensor observations.

  \item What would you have to set $\epsilon$ to be while keeping $\eta = 0.2$
  so that $\mathbb P(C_2 = 1 \mid D_2 = 0) = \mathbb P(C_2 = 1 \mid D_2 = 0, D_3
  = 1)$? Explain your intuition in terms of the car positions with respect to
  the observations.
